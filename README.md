description:  


        This Python script fetches 5-day weather forecast data from the OpenWeatherMap API for a specified city. It then visualizes key weather parameters like temperature, humidity, and wind speed over time using Matplotlib. The script generates a "dashboard" of plots saved as a PNG image, offering a clear overview of the predicted weather conditions.
